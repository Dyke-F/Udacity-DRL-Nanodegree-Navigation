# Udacity-DRL-Nanodegree-Navigation
*Navigation Project of Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree*

This programm contains my work for "Project 1: Navigation" of [Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

## Aim of the project
The goal is to apply deep reinforcement learning techniques to train an agent to move through a virtual grid world and collect as many yellow bananas as possible (giving a reward of +1), while avoiding blue bananas (leading to a reward of -1). Overall, collecting >= 13 yellow bananas on the average across the last 100 episodes is required to succesfully complete this project.

## Overview of a smart agent
![Trained Agent][image1]

Example actions taken by an trained agent as provided by [Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/p1_navigation/README.md).

## Implementation
Instructions on who to complete this challenge are open ended. In this repository, the agent is implemented using a Double Deed Q-Learning Network (DDQN) as its policy in PyTorch. 
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

## Getting started

### Installation requirements

- You first need to configure a Python 3.6 / PyTorch 0.4.0 environment with the needed requirements as described in the [Udacity repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies)
- Of course you have to clone this project and have it accessible in your Python environment
- Then you have to install the Unity environment as described in the [Getting Started section](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/p1_navigation/README.md) (The Unity ML-agant environment is already configured by Udacity)

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.
    
2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 
    
## User instructions

To teach the agent, open an instance of Jupyter Notebook and exectute `Main.ipynb`. Follow instructions inside the notebook.
